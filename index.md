## Hello!

I'm a Mechanical Engineer and Roboticist with over five years of experience in designing dexterous and low-cost soft robotic hands. My research combines rapid prototyping techniques, design optimization, and machine learning to make robot hands more accessible and easier to use. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I hold a B.Sc and M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu) (KIT) in Germany.


In 2020, I was awarded a Fellowship by the [Center for Machine Learning and Health](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/cmlh/) for creating soft dexterous upper-limb prostheses. Before my Ph.D. journey, I gained valuable industry experience as a Machine Learning Intern at [Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America](https://mbrdna.com/).

My current research involves automating soft robotic hand design through a combination of computer-aided design (CAD), optimization, simulation, and motion capture. Additionally, I am a member of the [AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA)](https://aiira.iastate.edu/), where I am exploring the application of soft robot hands for automated harvesting, to increase the deployment of robots in real-world environments.
